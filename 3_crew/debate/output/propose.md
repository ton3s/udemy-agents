It is clear that AI-generated code, particularly from advanced tools like GitHub Copilot, can effectively apply SOLID principles better than most human developers. The SOLID principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—are fundamental to creating clean, maintainable object-oriented code. 

Firstly, AI tools can analyze vast amounts of code from various sources, allowing them to learn best practices and recognize patterns that adhere to these principles. Unlike human developers, who may have varying levels of experience and understanding of these principles, AI can consistently apply them due to its training on a broad spectrum of coding styles that showcase best practices. 

Secondly, AI-generated suggestions are often based on real-time context and can promote adherence to SOLID principles which prevent complexities from accumulating in codebases. For instance, when developing functions, GitHub Copilot can suggest that developers break down functionalities, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, thus improving code maintainability and readability. 

Moreover, the scalable nature of AI means it does not suffer from fatigue or cognitive overload, common issues that many developers face when juggling multiple responsibilities or working under tight deadlines. This leads to consistently better adherence to established coding standards. 

In addition, the ongoing improvements in AI tools allow them to evolve. With continuous updates and learning from more recent code and trends, AI can adapt quickly and apply up-to-date SOLID principles in ways that human developers, who may be constrained by their educational backgrounds and experiences, might struggle to keep pace with.

In conclusion, as AI tools like GitHub Copilot become more sophisticated, they are positioned to not only match human capabilities but often exceed them in consistently applying SOLID principles, ultimately leading to producing clean and maintainable object-oriented code at scale. Thus, I firmly support the motion that AI-generated code can indeed effectively apply SOLID principles better than most human developers.
